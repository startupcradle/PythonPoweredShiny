# Overview

Three files are used to create the Dashboard:

1.   a script to define the user interface (ui.R)
2.   a script to set the server that responds to UI actions and displays the charts (server.R)
3.   a supporting file that creates variables and functions that are globally available to bother the server and UI scripts (global.R).

# Running the Dashboard

Simply open any of the file R files; server, ui or global. Once open you will see a "Run" icon in the upper right hand side of the script pane, click that option.

Adjacent to the "Run" icon is a dropdown, select "Run External" before running.
